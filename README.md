# Uni_Projects

This repository contains few projects done during my university days. The projects in tis repo are not easily reproducible as requirements.txt is not present and few projects are not complete, and few other issues. The projects are uploaded just for showcasing and for me to remember some of what i did during my uni days.

The following projects are included -
1. **ML-Assignment** - This project analyses covid data and answers a few questions regarding the spread of covid. A large amount of data was used for this project, henche big data tools like pyspark and machine learning. A Clustering algorithm (K means) was the star of this show.
2. **Forcasting** - This project forecasts sales data for a week in future. The data used for this project was time-series in nature hence algorithms like ARIMA, FB Prophet, Holt-Winters etc were compared.
3. **parallel1 and parallel2** - Sparse Matrix multiplication using parallel computing was implemented using two different methods. MPI library us used (a C library).
4. **streaming-1st-query** - This project is incomplete, this project uses kafka and pyspark to stream taxi data from a file and calculate stats in "real time". This file just includes the 1st query, the complete project consisted of 3 queries and kafka configuration.
5. **object-detection** - This project detects the vortex core formed around the golf ball. This study can give us insights as to the aerodynamics of the golf ball.
